# Spotify-clone-
HTML AND CSS using spotify clone
This project is like a picture of Spotify, made with just HTML and CSS. It doesn't play music, but it looks like Spotify. We used colors, fonts, and layouts that look the same. Everything is organized neatly, and we used tricks with HTML and CSS to make it look right. You can see it on different computers, and it works well. In the futuret. You can use and share this project because it's open for everyone
